# Bank App With MongoDB

## Description
This was a project for the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN program. This project demonstrates setting up a front end that communicates with an Express server. The server uses a MongoDB database to hold user account data.

## Installation
[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository. You’ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) installed on your computer. You can optionally use [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) for a graphical view of the MongoDB database.

After the project is on your computer, run ’npm install’ to get all the dependancies for this project.

To create a MongoDB database instance with docker, run the following:  
docker run -p 27017:27017 -name bank-app -d mongo
